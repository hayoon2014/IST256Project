The Airport.ipynb file collects data from the Syracuse Hancock International Airport flight information website, and stores the information in a different file, flightdata.xml. The information is updated everytime the Airport.ipynb file is run. It will show proper error messages in the cases the information website or your internet is unresponsive. Flightdata.xml is then organized to check if the user input flight number is canceled, arriving to the airport, or departing from the airport. For bad inputs (i.e. non-existing flight numbers), it will tell the user the flight isn't arriving to or departing from the airport. If the flight is canceled, it will tell the user the flight has been canceled. If the user input flight is arriving to or departing from the airport, it will tell the user the city it's headed to or coming from, the scheduled arrival/departure time, and the actual arrival/departure time in military time.
